This is a template for a mod installer for games, specifically unity games to modify their Assembly-CSharp.dll. The dll in these releases are for a game called Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy. The .py and .exe file have the same functionality which checks for the latest version of the Assembly-CSharp.dll, and if the current version is outdated the installer will download the newest one from the releases.
